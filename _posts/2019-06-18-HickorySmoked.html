<p>In my previous blog post I talked about the Tennessee Tasters’ High Angel’s Share Barrels, in this post I cover the second release in the series, Hickory Smoked. The bottle is labelled as "Tennessee Whiskey Finish with Charred Hickory Staves". </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>Smoked Hickory Finish</strong> – a fully matured whiskey finished with charred hickory staves for a smoky flavor at 100-proof, just in time for the 30<sup>th</sup> annual Jack Daniel’s World Championship Invitational BBQ which is held in Lynchburg on Oct. 27. Selected by Master Taster Marsha Hale and available late-October.

<p>This selection was from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marsha-hale-82543b37/" target="_blank">master taster Marsha Hale</a>, whom according to her Linked In profile has worked at Jack Daniel’s for almost 31 years. </p>

<p>I have yet to decide if I will try these bottles myself. I do have two of each, with the original intention of keeping one and having the other for trading to fill my collection with missing items. If however I could come across some other bottles, I would likely try one out myself, only time will tell if that happens.</p>
