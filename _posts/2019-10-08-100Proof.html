<p>There are some items that Jack Daniels’s chooses to release, that can only be acquired while travelling, via Duty Free shops. If you haven’t travelled out of the United States before, you can’t shop duty free, at least to purchase alcohol, unless you are travelling to/from overseas. </p>
<p>One of the items that you can buy, at least for the past couple of years, in Duty Free is the Single Barrel 100 Proof, a traveler’s exclusive. Since its release, I haven’t travelled out of the country, so when my friends travel out of the country, I ask them to keep an eye out!</p>
<p>Just recently a friend of mine travelled to Banff Canada, and on his way back he picked up a bottle of Single Barrel 100 Proof for me! I love presents (I paid him for it).</p>
<p>The bottle comes in a wood grained box, colored in a dark grey. The front of the box reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>100 Proof</p>
<p>Jack Daniel’s </p>
<p>Uniquely Crafted Handmade Barrels</p>
<p>Single Barrel 100 Proof</p>
<p>Tennessee Whiskey</p>
<p>Travelers’ Exclusive</p></blockquote>
<p>The right side of the box:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Single Barrel 100 Proof Bottled In Bond</p>
<p>Hand-selected Jack Daniel Distillery, Lynchburg, Tenn.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rear of the box:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jack Daniel’s </p>
<p>Uniquely Crafted Handmade Barrels</p>
<p>Single Barrel 100 Proof</p>
<p>Tennessee Whiskey</p>
<p>Travelers’ Exclusive</p>
<p>Single Barrel 100 Proof Tennessee Whiskey is a limited availability offering, matured in unique, handmade oak barrels and bottled in bond. Our 100 proof expression offers the perfect balance of toasted oak barrel, sweet vanilla and light spice notes, delivering an exceptionally smooth finish. Our bottled in bond Single Barrel is the perfect whiskey to savor with just a single cube of ice.</p></blockquote>
<p>The left side of the box:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uniquely Crafted Handmade Barrels</p></blockquote>
<p>The bottle is your standard single barrel bottle, with a silver label with black writing. The front of the bottle reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jack Daniel’s </p>
<p>Uniquely Crafted Handmade Barrels</p>
<p>Single Barrel 100 Proof</p>
<p>Tennessee Whiskey</p>
<p>50% Vol 705mL</p>
<p>Lynchburg</p>
<p>Tenn.</p>
<p>Bottled in Bond</p></blockquote>
<p>The rear of the bottle reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traveler’s Exclusive</p>
<p>Single Barrel 100 Proof Tennessee Whiskey Bottled In Bond pairs bold toasted oak barrel flavors with sweet vanilla and light spice notes for an exceptionally smooth finish.</p></blockquote>
<p>At this point I only have one bottle, I hope to pick up another at some point so that I can give this 100 Proof a taste. This bottle I have, was bottled on my birthday! March 15th, 2019</p>
