<p>In May of 2019 Jack Daniel’s released the second in their Legacy Edition line. TotalWine.com has the bottled described as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tennessee- The second release in the limited edition Legacy Series is reminiscent of an early 1900s era design. Its anchor and rope crest and black background speak to the quiet confidence and character of the Tennessee Whiskey that rests within.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the label is predominantly black, it has notes of gold and red, along with gray and white decorating the design. The front label reads</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rich Mellow</p>
<p>Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7</p>
<p>Old Time Sour Mash</p>
<p>Distilled And Bottled By</p>
<p>Jack Daniel Distillery</p>
<p>Lynchburg, Tennessee, USA</p>
<p>43% Alc. By Vol. (86 Proof)</p></blockquote>
<p>The right side of the bottle reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Legacy Edition 2</p>
<p>Our second bottling in the Limited Edition Legacy Series is reminiscent of an early 1900s era design. Its anchor and rope crest and black background speak to the quiet confidence and character of the Tennessee whiskey that rests within.</p>
<p>“Every day we make it, we’ll make it the best we can”</p>
<p>Jack Daniel</p></blockquote>
<p>The left side of the bottle reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Oldest Registered Distillery In The United States</p>
<p>DSP-TENN No. 1 Est. 1866</p>
<p>Old No. 7 Brand</p>
<p>Charcoal Mellowed Drop By Drop</p>
<p>Matured in Barrels of Our Own Making</p>
<p>Every Barrel Is Different Every Bottles Tastes The Same</p></blockquote>
<p>The bottle should be available in all 50 states, if you don’t see it yet, check again soon. I received a call from my local liquor store yesterday to stay it arrived. I went and picked up two bottles and was able to get a cardboard box for the Legacy Edition 2 case as well. Nothing fancy, but cool none the less.</p>
<p><strong>Release</strong>: 2019<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 86<br><strong>Size</strong>: 750ml<br><strong>Price:</strong> $24.99</p>
