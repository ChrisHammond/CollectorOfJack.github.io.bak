<p>In 2011 Jack Daniel's released the first (of 4) in their series of Holiday Select bottles of Jack Daniel's. The limited edition bottles were essentially Jack Daniel's single barrel bottles, but this collection consisted of whiskey from the barrels used in the Holiday Barrel Tree built near Lynchburg Tennessee's town square. I was fortunate enough to collect all 4 in the series, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Stay tuned for posts about each of them as we get into this 2018 holiday season.</p>
<p>The 2011 bottle came in a matte black box, with a clam shell opening on the top.&nbsp; The front of the box reads “<a href="https://www.jackdaniels.com/en-us/whiskey/limited/2011-holiday-select" target="_blank">Jack Daniel's Holiday Select 2011 Limited Edition</a>”. The back of the box reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THIS JACK DANIEL'S LIMITED EDITION WHISKEY IS FROM THE BARRELS WE USED TO CRAFT IN OUR 2011 HOLIDAY BARREL TREE NEAR THE TOWN SQURE IN LYNCHBURG, TENNESSEE. THE WHISKEY HAS BEEN SELECTED FOR ITS PERFECT BALANCE OF OAK AND VANILLA CHARACTER BRINGING A SPECIAL QUALITY TO YOUR HOLIDAY SEASON. WE HOPE YOU'LL FIND ADDED WARMTH IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS BOTTLE WILL BE USED TO HLP U.S. SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN TRAVEL HOME DURING THE HOLIDAYS.</p></blockquote>
<p>Inside the box. you'll find a bottle labeled “Limited 2011 Edition”, “Jack Daniel's Holiday Select Tennessee Whiskey”. On the back of the bottle you'll find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THIS JACK DANIEL'S LIMITED EDITION IS FROM BARRELS WE USED TO CRAFT OUR HOLIDAY BARREL TREE NEAR THE TOWN SQUARE IN LYNCHBURG, TENNESSEE. THE WHISKEY HAS BEEN SELECTED FOR ITS PERFECT BALANCE OF OAK AND VANILLA CHARACTER BRINING A SPECIAL QUALITY TO YOUR HOLIDAY SEASON.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 2011 bottle is 50% Alcohol, or 100 Proof. You can find it online for sale from a couple of retailers, lowest price I've found is $199 as of December 3, 2018.</p>
