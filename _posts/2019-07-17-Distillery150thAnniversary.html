<p>In 2016 Jack Daniel's celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Jack Daniel's Distillery in Lynchburg, TN. They commemorated this with a special edition bottle in a black and gold label.</p>
<p>The front of the bottle reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jack Daniel's </p>
<p>1866 150th 2016</p>
<p>Anniversary of the Jack Daniel Distillery</p>
<p>A Special 86 Proof Old No.7</p>
<p>Tennessee Whiskey</p>
<p>Distilled &amp; Bottled By</p>
<p>Jack Daniel Distillery</p>
<p>Lynchburg, Tennessee, USA</p>
<p>43% Alc By Vol. (86 Proof)</p></blockquote>
<p>The right side of the bottle reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Special Eight-six Proof Old No.7 Is a Tribute to a Legacy of Whiskey Craftsmanship &amp; The Birthplace of an American Classic</p></blockquote>
<p>The left side reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The year 2016 Marks 150 Years of Jack Daniel Distillery The Oldest Registered Distillery in The United States of America</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't believe the bottle was limited in release, and was likely available in all 50 states. I haven't seen one on a shelf in quite a few years however. You can find it online for around $130.</p>
<p><strong>Release</strong>: 2016<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 86<br><strong>Size</strong>: 750ml<br><strong>Price:</strong> $24.99</p>
