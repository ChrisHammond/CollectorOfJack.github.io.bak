description: A collector's guide to the Jack Daniel's Holiday Select Release from 2013
---
<p>In our <a href="https://collectorofjack.com/HolidaySelect2012" target="_blank">last blog post we covered the second in the Holiday Select series</a>, in this one, we cover the third, the Holiday Select 2013 Limited Edition bottle from Jack Daniel’s. </p>
<p>The bottle comes in a black box, like 2012, this box isn’t a clamshell opening. The bottle and an insert slide out the top of the box. The back of the box reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THIS JACK DANIEL’S LIMITED EDITION IS FROM BARRELS WE USED TO CRAFT OUR HOLIDAY BARREL TREE. FOR 2013, OUR MASTER DISTILLER, JEFF ARNETT, HAS SELECTED WHISKEY WITH THE RICK CHARACTER OF TOASTED OAK AND SPICE NOTESDRAWN FROM OUR HANDCRAFTED BARRELS. WE HOPE IT BRINGS A SPECIAL QUALITY FOR YOUR HOLIDAY SEASON.</p></blockquote>
<p>The shape of the bottle is the same as the 2011 and 2012 bottle. Like the 2012 bottle, labelling has some gold instead of all white. The holly berry leaves are also in green, instead of the white as in 2011. Also differing from the 2011 bottle, the text on the back of the bottle now matches the text on the back of the box. </p>
<p>The 2013 bottle is 49% Alcohol, or 98 Proof, up from 90.4 the year before. Finding this one online appears a little more difficult, I found one on ebay listed at $179 as of December 8, 2018. </p>

<p><strong>Release</strong>: December 2013<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 98<br><strong>Size</strong>: 750ml</p>
