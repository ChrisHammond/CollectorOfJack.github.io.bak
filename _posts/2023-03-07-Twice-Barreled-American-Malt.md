It's been a while since I've blogged about a real bottle, that doesn't mean I haven't been collecting. I simply got it in my head that I needed the perfect backdrop for my photos.

What is Oloroso Sherry?
>Oloroso Sherry Cask are whisky casks which have been previously held Oloroso Sherry. Oloroso Sherry is a type of fortified wine produced near the city of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain. The Sherry Triangle produces wines which have been ‘fortified’ with a higher alcohol strength in order to prevent yeast growth and bottled under the official name of Jerez-Xérès-Sherry. There is something of a manufactured misconception, that the casks used at these bodegas are the same used for whisky maturation however this is not the case. Oloroso sherry casks are more commonly known as sherry butts within the whisky industry. - [WhiskeyPedia](https://whiskipedia.com/fundamentals/oloroso-sherry-casks/)
