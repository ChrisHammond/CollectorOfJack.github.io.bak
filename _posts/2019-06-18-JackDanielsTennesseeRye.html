<p>In September of 2017 Jack Daniel's released their standard bottle of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye, their 70% rash mash bill. This is a more affordable version of the Rye from Jack Daniel's than the <a href="https://collectorofjack.com/JackDanielsSingleBarrelRye" target="_blank">Single Barrel Rye</a> released in 2016. </p>
<p>The bottle is your standard square bottle from Jack Daniel's, though the label has a tan background with black writing and green highlights. The front of the bottle reads:</p><blockquote><p align="center">Jack Daniel's <br><br>Barrel Aged <br>Rye<br>Moore CO.<br><br>Tennessee <br>Straight <br>Rye Whiskey<br><br>Distilled &amp; Bottled By<br>Jack Daniel Distillery<br>Lynchburg, Tenn USA<br>45% ALC.Vol. (90 Proof)</p><p align="center">Every Drop made in Lynchburg Tennessee<br>Quality and craftsmanship since 1866</p></blockquote>
<p>The side of the bottle reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye brings together two classics - rye's distinctive flavor, drawn from our unique 70% rye grain bill, and Jack's time-honored charcoal mellowing method. What emerges is a spicy whiskey that's sippin' smooth. <br>Jeff Arnett<br>Master Distiller<br>”Every day we make it, we'll make it the best we can”</p></blockquote>
<p>The back adds:</p><blockquote><p align="center">Made only in <br>Lynchburg<br>Tennessee<br>U.S.A.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the other side reads:</p><blockquote><p align="center">Rye Grain<br>Hand Selected / Imparting a full<br>and spicy character<br><br>Mellowed<br>For smoothness / Drop by drop through<br>Sugar Maple Charcoal<br><br>Matured<br>For characters / In our own<br>Handcrafted Barrels</p></blockquote>
<p>Pictured in the photos here are both a 750ml and 1L bottle, only really differing in size and spacing of the content on the labels. These bottles can be found worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Release</strong>: 2017<br><strong>Proof</strong>: 90<br><strong>Size</strong>: 750ml/1L<br><strong>Price:</strong> $23/33<p><br><br></p>
